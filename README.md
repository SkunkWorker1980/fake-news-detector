![Fake News Detector](https://www.pantallasamigas.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fake-news.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a Fake News Detector that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and classify fake news articles. With the proliferation of digital media and the internet, fake news has become a significant problem. This tool aims to help users distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy news sources by analyzing the content of news articles.

## Features

- Detection of fake news using NLP techniques.
- Web scraping capability to fetch news articles from various sources.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Customizable with various NLP models and algorithms.
- Real-time analysis of news articles.
- Classification of news articles into "Fake" or "Real" categories.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, beautifulsoup4, requests, nltk
- NLP models: NLTK stopwords, word embeddings, TF-IDF, or pre-trained language models like BERT.
- A dataset of labeled fake and real news articles for training the model (see the [Data](#data) section).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkunkWorker1980/fake-news-detector.git
   cd fake-news-detector
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download or install the necessary NLP models as mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

## Usage

1. Training the model (optional but recommended):
   You can train the model using your own dataset of labeled news articles. Use the `train.py` script and provide the necessary parameters like dataset path, model type, and hyperparameters.

   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset dataset.csv --model bert --epochs 5
   ```

2. Detecting fake news:
   You can analyze news articles from various sources by providing a URL or directly inputting the text. Use the `detect.py` script.

   ```bash
   python detect.py --source-url https://example.com/news-article --model bert
   ```

3. The detector will classify the news article as "Fake" or "Real" based on the model's analysis.

## Data

To train the model, you will need a labeled dataset of fake and real news articles. You can curate your own dataset or find publicly available datasets like:

- [Fake News Corpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus)
- [LIAR dataset](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/data/liar_dataset.zip)
- [BuzzFeedNews' 'Fake News' data](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-01-fake-news-timeline)

## Model

You can choose from various NLP models for training your fake news detection model, including TF-IDF, word embeddings, or pre-trained language models like BERT. You can experiment with different models to achieve the best performance for your specific dataset.

## Performance

The performance of your fake news detection model may vary depending on the quality and size of your dataset, the chosen NLP model, and the hyperparameters. It's essential to regularly evaluate and fine-tune your model to maintain high accuracy in real-world scenarios.
